# Textitude

Textitude is a backend service and single page application that offers a SMS chat interface. 

SMS used to be the common baseline messaging service that everyone used. To maintain these connections and to liberate myself from being tied to certain phone companies for SMS services, I developed Textitude. As a happy bonus, it enabled me to type messages on a computer keyboard. 

It primarily uses Twilio as the messaging backend, though the design should allow other connectors, be that Android devices, or other services that may come up.
